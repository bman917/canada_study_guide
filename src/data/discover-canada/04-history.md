# Canada's History

## Aboriginal Peoples and European Contact

Indigenous peoples occupied all Canadian regions prior to European arrival. Various groups had distinct lifestyles:
- The Huron-Wendat and Iroquois farmed
- Northern groups hunted
- Coastal peoples preserved fish

European contact brought disease and transformed Indigenous ways of life, though early economic and military partnerships emerged between the groups.
