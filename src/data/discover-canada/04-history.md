# Canada's History

## Aboriginal Peoples and European Contact

Indigenous peoples occupied all Canadian regions prior to European arrival. Various groups had distinct lifestyles:
- The Huron-Wendat and Iroquois farmed
- Northern groups hunted
- Coastal peoples preserved fish

European contact brought disease and transformed Indigenous ways of life, though early economic and military partnerships emerged between the groups.

## Early European Exploration

- **c. 1000 CE:** Vikings reached Labrador and Newfoundland, establishing a settlement at **L'Anse aux Meadows**
- **1497:** John Cabot mapped Canada's Atlantic coast
- **1534-1542:** Jacques Cartier explored the St. Lawrence River for France

The name "Canada" derives from the Iroquoian word **"kanata"** meaning "village."

## Royal New France (1604-1701)

- **1604:** Samuel de Champlain established first settlements at St. Croix Island and Port-Royal

- French collaborated with Aboriginal peoples, particularly the Huron-Wendat, in the fur trade
- **French-Iroquois Wars:** Nearly a century of conflict ended with the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701

### Struggle for a Continent

- **1670:** Hudson's Bay Company established by English merchants to compete in the fur trade
- British colonies grew wealthier and more populous than New France
- **1759:** **Battle of the Plains of Abraham** at Quebec City: Britain defeated France, effectively ending French imperial control of North America. Both commanding generals, British **General James Wolfe** and French **General Louis-Joseph de Montcalm**, were killed in the battle.

## British Rule and Democratic Development

Following French defeat, Britain renamed the territory the "Province of Quebec."

### Quebec Act of 1774

Accommodated French Catholics by:
- Allowing religious freedom
- Permitting them to hold office

Over 40,000 Loyalists fled the American Revolution, settling in Canada, including **3,000 black Loyalists** who were freed slaves seeking refuge and freedom in Canada.

### Constitutional Act of 1791

- Established the first elected legislative assemblies
- The name "Canada" became official

## War of 1812

The United States invaded Canada with expectations of an easy victory, but Canadian volunteers, First Nations allies, and British troops successfully defended the territory.

**Major Battles:**
- **Battle of Queenston Heights (1812):** Major General Sir Isaac Brock died in this victory
- **Battle of Châteauguay (1813):** Charles de Salaberry led French-Canadian defenders to repel Americans

**Major Figures:**

## Rebellions of 1837-38

Armed uprisings occurred in Upper and Lower Canada, led by reformers seeking democratic change. The rebellions failed, but they prompted important reforms.

**Lord Durham's Report:** Following the rebellions, Lord Durham recommended responsible government (which was eventually granted) but controversially also suggested French-Canadian assimilation.

---

## Responsible Government

Reformers advocated for democratic governance where ministers required majority support in elected assemblies. This principle forms the foundation of Canada's parliamentary democracy today.

- **1847-48:** Nova Scotia achieved responsible government
- **1848-49:** Province of Canada achieved responsible government

**Sir Louis-Hippolyte La Fontaine:** A champion of French language rights and democracy, La Fontaine became the first leader of a responsible government in Canada, working alongside Robert Baldwin to establish this crucial democratic principle.

## Confederation and National Expansion

The **Fathers of Confederation**, representatives from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and the Province of Canada, worked together to create a new country with a federal system of two government levels.

### British North America Act (1867)

- Established the **Dominion of Canada** on **July 1**
- Founding provinces: Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia
- **Sir George-Etienne Cartier:** A key architect of Confederation from Quebec. A railway lawyer and close ally of Macdonald, Cartier led Quebec into Confederation.

The term "Dominion" came from Psalm 72, expressing a vision of a nation "from sea to sea."

Subsequent territorial additions brought the country to its modern boundaries by 1999 with Nunavut's creation.

### Canadian Pacific Railway (completed 1885)

On **November 7, 1885**, at Craigellachie, British Columbia, **Donald Smith** (later Lord Strathcona) drove the last spike, completing the Canadian Pacific Railway. This fulfilled the national vision of continental unity and British Columbia's condition for joining Confederation.

**Chinese Laborers:** Thousands of Chinese workers helped build the railway under harsh conditions. They faced discrimination through the Head Tax imposed after construction; Canada formally apologized in 2006.

### Western Settlement

**First French-Canadian Prime Minister:** **Sir Wilfrid Laurier** became Canada's first French-Canadian Prime Minister, serving from 1896 to 1911. He encouraged immigration to settle the West.
