# Who We Are

## The Three Founding Peoples

### Aboriginal Peoples

Ancestors of Aboriginal peoples migrated from Asia thousands of years ago. Aboriginal and treaty rights are constitutionally protected.

Three distinct groups comprise the Aboriginal population:

| Group | Population Share | Description |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| **First Nations** | ~65% of Aboriginal peoples | About half live on reserves |
| **Inuit** | ~4% of Aboriginal peoples | Inhabit Arctic communities |
| **Métis** | ~30% of Aboriginal peoples | Mixed Aboriginal-European ancestry, concentrated in Prairie provinces, speak Michif dialect |

**Historical Context:**
- **Royal Proclamation of 1763:** Britain's King George III guaranteed Aboriginal territorial rights, forming the basis of modern treaties
- **Residential Schools (1800s-1980s):** Inflicted hardship on Aboriginal children through forced assimilation; Ottawa formally apologized in 2008

### English Canadians

- Approximately 18 million Anglophones
- English is one of two official languages

### French Canadians

- Approximately 7 million Francophones
- French is one of two official languages

**Acadians:** French colonist descendants who settled in the Maritimes beginning in 1604. They survived the "Great Upheaval" deportations (1755-1763) and maintained their identity despite persecution.

**Quebecers:** Majority French-speaking population; recognized as "a nation within a united Canada" (2006).

**Anglo-Quebecers:** 1 million residents with 250-year heritage.
