## The Oath of Citizenship

### English Version

> "I swear (or affirm) That I will be faithful And bear true allegiance To His Majesty King Charles the Third King of Canada His Heirs and Successors And that I will faithfully observe The laws of Canada Including the Constitution Which recognizes and affirms The Aboriginal and treaty rights of First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples And fulfil my duties as a Canadian citizen."

### French Version

> "Je jure (ou j'affirme solennellement) Que je serai fidèle Et porterai sincère allégeance À Sa Majesté Le roi Charles Trois Roi du Canada À ses héritiers et successeurs Que j'observerai fidèlement Les lois du Canada Y compris la Constitution Qui reconnaît et confirme les droits Ancestraux ou issus de traités Des Premières Nations, des Inuits et des Métis Et que je remplirai loyalement Mes obligations De citoyen canadien."

### Understanding the Oath

Canada's constitutional monarchy framework centers on loyalty to a person representing all citizens rather than abstract symbols. In our constitutional monarchy, these elements are encompassed by the Sovereign who personifies both the nation and its people.

The oath emphasizes:
- Aboriginal and treaty rights of Indigenous peoples
- Reference to King Charles III (current monarch)

## Message to Our Readers

It took courage to move to a new country. Your decision to apply for citizenship is another big step.

Canada has received immigrants for 400 years who built a free, law-abiding and prosperous society. The country operates as a constitutional monarchy, parliamentary democracy, and federal state.

Citizens share commitment to rule of law and parliamentary institutions.

### Citizenship Knowledge Requirements

Applicants must understand:
- Voting procedures

- Democratic institutions
- Geography
- Rights and responsibilities of citizenship

**Note:** As of October 11, 2017, applicants aged 18-54 years must demonstrate adequate knowledge of Canada through a citizenship test in English or French.

Canadian citizens enjoy many rights, but Canadians also have responsibilities. These include obeying laws and respecting others' freedoms.
