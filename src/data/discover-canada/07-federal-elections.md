## Post-Election Government Formation

The leader of the party winning the most House of Commons seats is invited to form government and becomes Prime Minister.

### Types of Government

| Type | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Majority Government** | Party holds at least half the seats |
| **Minority Government** | Party holds less than half the seats |

The Prime Minister selects Cabinet ministers, who lead federal departments and propose budgets and legislation.

**Responsible government** means the ministers of the Crown must have the support of a majority of elected representatives. If they lose a **confidence vote** in the House of Commons, they must resign.
