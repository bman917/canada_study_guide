# How Canadians Govern Themselves

Canada's government is based on three key principles:

1. **Federal State**
2. **Parliamentary Democracy**
3. **Constitutional Monarchy**

---

## 1. Federal State

Canada operates as a federal system with distinct government levels.

### Division of Powers

| Level | Responsibilities |
|-------|------------------|
| **Federal Government** | Defence, foreign policy, interprovincial trade, communications, currency, navigation, criminal law, citizenship |
| **Provincial Governments** | Municipal government, education, health, natural resources, property rights, highways |
| **Shared Jurisdiction** | Agriculture and immigration |

Northern territories function similarly to provinces despite smaller populations.

Federalism allows different provinces to adopt policies tailored to their own populations.

## 2. Parliamentary Democracy

### Structure of Parliament

- **Prime Minister:** Selects Cabinet and directs government operations
- **House of Commons:** Elected representatives (elections typically every 4 years)
- **Senate:** Appointed members serving until age 75
- **Governor General:** Appoints senators on PM advice

### The Three Branches of Government

1. **Executive:** Prime Minister and Cabinet
2. **Legislative:** House of Commons and Senate
3. **Judicial:** Courts

### How a Bill Becomes Law

1. **First Reading:** Bill printed
2. **Second Reading:** Debate principles
3. **Committee Stage:** Clause-by-clause review
4. **Report Stage:** Amendments possible
5. **Third Reading:** Debate and vote
6. **Senate:** Parallel process
7. **Royal Assent:** Final approval by Governor General

## 3. Constitutional Monarchy

Canada's Head of State is a hereditary Sovereign (King or Queen) who reigns in accordance with the Constitution and the rule of law.

### Key Representatives

| Position | Role |
|----------|------|
| **Governor General** | Represents the Sovereign federally |
| **Lieutenant Governors** | Represent the Sovereign in each province |
| **Commissioners** | Represent federal government in territories |

### Important Distinction

- **The Sovereign:** Symbolic head of state
- **The Prime Minister:** Head of government directing actual operations
